# Amsterdam Time Machine

This repository contains materials regarding the build up of an Amsterdam Time Machine, a hub for historical Linked (Open) Data (LOD) on Amsterdam. We focus on combining materials derived from textual sources, multimedia sources (images, video) and so called structured data (tables). The data currently reside as Linked Data in a SPARQL endpoint at https://druid.datalegend.net/ATM-DEMO/ATM-CLARIAH-DEMO. For the original data please check the directories in this repository. To read more on the ATM itself, please visit http://www.create.humanities.uva.nl/uncategorized/amsterdam-time-machine/ .
