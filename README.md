# Amsterdam Time Machine

This repository contains materials regarding the build up of an Amsterdam Time Machine, a hub for historical Linked (Open) Data (LOD) on Amsterdam. We focus on combining materials derived from textual sources, multimedia sources (images, video) and so called structured data (tables).
